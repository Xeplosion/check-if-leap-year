Welcome the user.

Create the user prompt for a 4 digit year input. (remember the blank lines)

CALCULATION IDEAS:

use a for loop to avoid exceed the maximum allowed if elif else statements?

potentially use a lot of variables before the if statement to prevent it from getting too large and ugly.

Leap year requirements:

divisible by 9,
that last two digits do not match,
the sum of the last two digits equals the first two digits ex. 1165 != leap year

SO THEREFORE

leap = 0

firstTwo = math.floor(year / 100)
lastTwo = year - year % 100
sumLastTwo = int(lastTwo[0] + lastTwo[1])
remainder = year % 9
if remainder = 0 and firstTwo != sumLastTwo:

elif if year[2] != year[3]:

else:



Create the output following the given requirements:

fist line always the same no matter the result,
must use the year the user entered in line 2,
second line must be indented,
state whether the year entered is a leap year.
